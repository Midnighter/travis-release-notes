Testing the [improved release notes
handling](https://github.com/travis-ci/dpl/pull/1069) that just landed on Travis
Ci.

The improved feature promises full markdown capabilities for release notes that
are either submitted as string `--release-notes` or as a file
`--release-notes-file`. This demo repository tests these features. I use the
[markdown
cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) in
order to cover a wide range of markdown constructs.
